AERO-generator
==============

A free web-based application for generating AERO diagrams from spreadsheet data using the tikz package for LaTeX. The AERO (Accumulating Evidence and Research Organization) diagram is based on Spencer Hey's paper (Hey et al. Trials 2013, 14:159) and the application was written by Benjamin Carlisle and Andrew Chung, members of the STREAM research group in the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University.
